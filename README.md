# Jabberwoky - A Uno Bot
Jabberwoky is a bot which can play the Uno card game. It was developed as part of [DumbergerL's Uno Bot Challenge](https://github.com/DumbergerL/uno-server).

It is written in pure Go and only uses Go's standard library.

[This commit](https://github.com/staubichsauger/jabberwoky/commit/9d9a0d4f285adedd59f6871ecb1289b23a030271) shows the code as it was after the competition.

## Uno-Bot Challenge
